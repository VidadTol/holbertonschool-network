This diagram illustrates the **web request flow** when a user types `https://www.google.com` into their browser and presses **Enter**.

It represents:
- âœ… **DNS Resolution** â†’ The domain name is converted to an IP address via a DNS server.

- âœ… **Server Connection** â†’ The request reaches the server's IP address via the **TCP/IP** protocol.

- âœ… **Security with HTTPS/SSL** â†’ Traffic is **encrypted** to ensure confidentiality.

- âœ… **Firewall Passage** â†’ The request is filtered for security reasons.

- âœ… **Load Balancer Distribution** â†’ Traffic is distributed among several available servers.

- âœ… **Web server processing** â†’ The server **serves the static files** required for the page.

- âœ… **Application server execution** â†’ It **generates the dynamic content**.

- âœ… **Database interaction** â†’ Data is retrieved and displayed on the page.

In summary, it shows the **entire processing cycle** of a web request up to the display of the Google page! ðŸš€
