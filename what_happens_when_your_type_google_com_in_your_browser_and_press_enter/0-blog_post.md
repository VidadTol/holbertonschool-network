## **When you enter a URL into your browser and press Enter, several complex steps take place to display the web page you want to visit. Here is a detailed explanation of the different steps involved in this process.**

<br>

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ DNS Query ‚Äì Finding the Server's IP Address**

The browser doesn't directly understand domain names like `www.google.com`. It must **translate this name into an IP address** to know where to send the query.

1. **DNS Cache Check**:
- The browser first checks if it already has an IP address for `www.google.com` in memory. 2. **DNS Server Query**:
- If the IP address is not cached, a DNS query is sent to a DNS server (usually one provided by your Internet Service Provider or a service like Google DNS or Cloudflare).
3. **DNS Resolution**:
- The DNS server responds with the IP address of the Google server (e.g., 165.280.190.48).

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting via TCP/IP ‚Äì Establishing Communication**

Once the IP address is obtained, your browser **must establish a connection with the Google web server**.

1. **TCP Connection Establishment**:
- The **Transmission Control Protocol** is used to ensure reliable communication.

- The browser sends a **SYN** (synchronization) to the Google server.
- The Google server responds with a **SYN-ACK** (synchronization and confirmation). - The browser ends the exchange with **ACK**, thus establishing the connection.

2. **Transmission via IP**:
- Data travels over the network using the **Internet Protocol** (IP), which ensures that data packets arrive correctly at their destination.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Firewall Filtering ‚Äì Network Security**

Before reaching Google's servers, the request passes through several firewalls:

- **User Firewall**:
- Protects against threats and blocks certain malicious sites.
- **ISP Firewall**:
- Filters traffic to ensure the security of public networks.
- **Google Firewall**:
- Verifies that the request is authorized and protects against attacks such as DDoS.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Secure via HTTPS/SSL ‚Äì Data Encryption**

Once the connection is established, the exchanges between your browser and Google are secured using **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** and **SSL/TLS**.

1. **SSL Certificate**:
- The Google server presents its SSL certificate to prove its identity.
2. **Key Exchange**:
- Encryption is implemented via **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to secure the data.
3. **Secure Transmission**:
- All data exchanged between your browser and Google is now encrypted to prevent interception.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Load Balancer ‚Äì Traffic Distribution**

Google has **thousands of servers worldwide** to ensure the speed and availability of its service.

1. The Load Balancer redirects the request to an available server based on traffic and the user's location.

2. Algorithm Used: Google uses techniques such as Round Robin, Least Connections, and GeoDNS to optimize request handling.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Communication with the Web Server

Once the request is sent to a specific server:

- The web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) receives the request and checks which files should be displayed.

- It handles static content (HTML, CSS, images) and forwards dynamic requests to the application.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Processing by the Application Server

If the requested page contains dynamic content, it is processed by an application server, which executes code and interacts with the database.

- Examples of application servers: Node.js, Django, Spring, Ruby on Rails.

- This server generates dynamic HTML content and returns the results to the web server.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Database Interaction

If the page requests data (such as your Google preferences), the application server queries a database.

1. SQL Query:
- The server sends a query to retrieve the requested information.
2. Returned Result:
- The database responds with the corresponding data.
3. Display:
- The application server transforms this data into HTML and returns the page to the browser.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Final Display in the Browser

Finally, the browser receives the data and displays it as a web page.

**It interprets**:
- ‚úÖ **HTML** for page structure.
- ‚úÖ **CSS** for design and style.
- ‚úÖ **JavaScript** for dynamic interactions.

# And there you have it, **Google.com** in front of you! üöÄ

## **Conclusion**

Pressing **Enter** after typing `https://www.google.com` triggers an incredibly sophisticated process involving **DNS resolution, HTTPS security, load management, web servers, and databases**. Every millisecond counts to quickly display the desired page.
